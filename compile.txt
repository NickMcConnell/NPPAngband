Compiling Instructions 
 
(note: in all cases below, the NPPAngband* directory indicates the directory to 
which you 
have chosen to download the source code.)

===================================================================

Compiling on Windows:

NPPAngband compiles with MINGW, and should compile with CYGWIN as well.  
There are also file to compile with visual c++ Express.

To compile with MINGW, download and install MINGW, open a command prompt and navigate to the *NPP/src directory.

use the following command line (this should also work for CYGWIN as well):

make -f makefile.win MINGW=YES


===================================================================

Compiling on Linux:

The most up-to-date instruction will be found in this thread:

NPP 0.5.4 compiles for linux as follows:



These instructions are based on this page for compiling and running a local install of NPPAngband:

http://rephial.org/wiki/Compiling

1) Get the dependencies & source:

open a terminal and run the following command:

sudo apt-get install autoconf gcc libc6-dev libncurses5-dev libx11-dev ibsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libgtk2.0-dev libglade2-dev

Download source code (https://github.com/nppangband/NPPAngband) and extract into a directory of your choice:

2) Open a terminal and navigate to the *NPP directory.

3) enter the command:   "./autogen.sh"

4) enter the command:   "./configure --with-no-install --enable-sdl"  (There are various commands that can be used here to compile the game in different ways.  See configure.ac for various options.  This one enables the sdl port to compile in a local directory.  GCU also works with this command)

5) enter the command:   "make"

6) enter the command:    "make install"

NPP is now compiled and ready to play.

To run the GCU port, enter:  "./src/nppangband -mgcu"
To run the sdl port, enter:  "./src/nppangband -msdl"

The other two ports should be fixed in the next couple months.
